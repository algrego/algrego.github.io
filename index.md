Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. I am a social scientist working in the weather, water, and climate enterprise. My passion is in connecting groups of people to improve collaboration in the earth sciences and environmental efforts more broadly. 


### **Earth Data Science Analytics Course**

In Earth Data Science, I am excited about learning how coding projects and data science can connect to broader audiences and build bridges between scientists. I am also excited to improve my own coding skills so I am better able to work alongside my peers who utilized coding skills in their day to day work.

Questions I'd like to answer include
- How can we use data science to improve collaboration on science projects?
- What skills in Earth Data Science are transferrable to my current work?
- What resources are available to me through github and other free coding resources?
