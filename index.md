Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. I am a social scientist working in the weather, water, and climate enterprise. My passion is in connecting groups of people to improve collaboration in the earth sciences and environmental efforts more broadly. I currently work as the Community Engagement Specialist for the Unified Forecast System (UFS). The UFS helps get research into operations for earth system models, helping support the National Weather Service mission to protect property and save lives.


### **Earth Data Science Analytics Course**

In Earth Data Science, I am excited about learning how coding projects and data science can connect to broader audiences and build bridges between scientists. I am also excited to improve my own coding skills so I am better able to work alongside my peers who utilized coding skills in their day to day work.

Questions I'd like to answer include
- How can we use data science to improve collaboration on science projects?
- What skills in Earth Data Science are transferrable to my current work?
- What resources are available to me through github and other free coding resources?

### **Map Making Project - Bald Mountain Scenic Area**
This is a map of Bald Mountain Scenic Area, one of the protected open spaces close to my home in Boulder County. It's a beautiful easy hike to get out and breathe the fresh air!
